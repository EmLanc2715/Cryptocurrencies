# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies. A classification report was created for an investment bank to propose new cryptocurrency investment portfolios to clients. After the preprocessing and cleaning phase, there were 532 tradable cryptocurrencies. An elbow curve was created to determine that the best k value was 4, meaning there would be 4 different categorizing clusters.
